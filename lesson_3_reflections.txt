When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to do this to have access to my files anywhere and also to collaborate with others in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have control and only share when I am ready!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
The differences:
branches are other versions of files that branch off for different features etc and then can be bought back togeter again and merged.
clones are copies of files
forks - are like clones but just exist on github
Branch for features and parallel working on little bits and exoeriments
Clone to copy a whole repository
fork to get a copy if somone else file - do your own thing but give them a good pat on the back. Or to take their thing and make some changes to show them a better way to do it!!

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I think the benefit is that you can look through it and carefully egre once you are ready. You may need to look at it at a later time offline.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be hard to collaborate another way. I think you would just all have multiple versions saved and ned to manage them using an excel sheet or similar?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Yu would want to make changes to a separate branch to suggest a new feature or chane that was tbc without affecting the master.You need to remember what branch you are on and why (or remember to check) Obviously the commit messages help you to keep track of this.
