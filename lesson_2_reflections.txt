What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
So what happens is you turn that folder into a git repository. A .git hiden folder is added and this will sit in the background and store all the data about  the history of the file :D You do it to start using git!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging offers an interim space to gather both your files and thoughts before making  commit. I think it is useful to make you check youself and also to pass ofver individua elements once they are ready.
